Hola! Welcome to my portfolio. Let me introduce myself. I am a first-year graduate student in the [University of Southern California's](http://usc.edu) [Master of Science in Computer Science program](https://www.cs.usc.edu/academic-programs/masters/computer-science-general/). I am currently looking for summer 2023 internship positions and would love to chat /discuss if you have something in mind for me. 

A sneak-peek into my professional journey:
I pursued my undergrad studies at [Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetam](https://www.amrita.edu/), majoring in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.amrita.edu/program/btech-computer-science-and-engineering/), and graduated in 2020. I started my professional journey with [Philips](https://www.philips.com/global) as a Software Engineer, where I worked on Operating Systems as part of the Build and Operating systems team (BOS). One year later, desiring to explore the Big Data domain, I joined [Informatica](https://www.informatica.com/) as a Software Engineer 2. I worked as a C++ developer on the transformation execution engine of the proprietary Big Data Management tool. 

You may refer to the [CV](/cv/) section for a detailed insight into my professional journey.
