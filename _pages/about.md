Hola! Welcome to my portfolio. I am a first-year Master's student at the [University of Southern California](http://usc.edu) majoring in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.usc.edu/academic-programs/masters/computer-science-general/). I am looking for internship opportunities this summer and am happy to chat/ discuss.

I am a passionate engineer with 2.5 years of real-world software development experience at firms like [Philips](https://www.philips.com/global) and [Informatica](https://www.informatica.com/). I also find my interest in Deep Learning and its applications in the Computer Vision domain. To quench this thirst, I have collaborated with professors from institutes like the [Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology](https://www.iist.ac.in/) and published my research findings in top-tier conferences like COCONET. 

You may refer to the [CV](/cv/) section for a detailed insight into my professional journey.
