### Background:
Corporate and Industry Relations (CIR) wing in my undergraduate school wanted to keep track of students attending the coding sessions (named Stay Late and Code) hosted as part of recruitment training. An efficient solution was required to prevent proxies and to ensure that students physically visit the sessions.

### Solution:
We engineered a web-based application to which students can signup or log in. The login duration represents the work hours of a student in the lab. An admin dashboard enabled management to track the performance of each student. 

### Project Information:
**Tech Stack:** AngularJS, PHP, MySQL, PHPMyAdmin <br/>
**Team size:** 6

### Unique Features:
1. **Geo-Fencing:** The application is intelligent to identify students logging from other locations and block them. The robustness of this feature yielded an increase of 67% physical attendance post this feature.
2. **Interactive dashboards:** Interactive admin dashboard enabled admins to add/ delete/ update student information. The student dashboard pictorially represents the hours spent by each student for a week.
3. **Compete with friends:** To promote healthy competition among students, daily stats are displayed on the student dashboard. Students can also add their friends to share their progress.
4. **Extendable:** The project is highly modularized and several new features like tracking studentsâ€™ performance in various Online judges can be featured with very little work.

### Roles and responsibilities:
1. Participated in project brainstorming and suggested key features like geo-fencing and Competing with friends.
2. As part of the backend team, I designed the database schema to be as efficient as possible while ensuring extendability
3. As part of the frontend team, handled all card views in the admin dashboard.
