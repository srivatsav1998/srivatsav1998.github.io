      institution: Informatica, Bangalore, Karnataka
      year: 11/2021 - 07/2022
      description:
        - Maintained 3 vital components (adapters SDK, eDTM, and Lineage service) of Data Engineering Integration (DEI) product comprising 30+ sub-components developed in C++ & JAVA.
        - Experienced in debugging issues involving extreme multi-threading (>#50) and recursion depths beyond 15.
        - Spent 700+ hours debugging legacy and complex logics of Joiner, Expression, and Router Transformations to fix critical customer issues.
        - Got recognised for on-point debugging and analysis from the top management.
    - title: Software Engineer - 1
      institution: Philips Innovation Campus, Bangalore, Karnataka
      year: 01/2020 - 10/2021
      description:
        - Devised an auto recovery mechanism for remotely connected Gantry Display devices in event of failure; there by saving US$1 million (1M) spent on shipping these corrupted gantry devices yearly.
        - Worked on harmonizing and automating the OS build and deployment pipelines across several Business Units. While reducing risk of manual errors, this saves 40+ man-hours required to release a new OS version every month.
        - Designed an automated and self-reliant component test framework to seamlessly validate hundreds of component configurations involved in OS & ISO building.
        - Conceptualized a robust automation tool to reduce 95% of manual steps required for configuring multiple displays of a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) console machine.

    - title: Summer Research Intern
      institution: Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala
      year: 05/2019 - 07/2019
      description: 
        - Overhauled SiameseFC tracker by incorporating RefineNet modules to solve short-term sub-track of Visual Object Tracking challenge. The model was designed and developed using a MATLAB toolbox, MatConvNet.
        - Attained an average IoU of 0.336 on unseen video sequences of VOT2013 and VOT2016 Short-Term track datasets and was trained on ILSVRC2015 VID dataset.

      institution: Amrita School of Engineering, Bangalore, Karnataka
      year: 06/2018 - 07/2018
      description:
        - Performed a detailed study on the correlation between Batch Size and inference times with 4 different CPU and GPU architectures on 6 major CNN models.
        - Achieved an average speedup of 1.62x in CNN inference times with novel split and re-split strategies which efficiently balance workload among different hardware architectures in a heterogeneous cluster.
        - Formulated and presented the results at ICACCS2020 conference.
